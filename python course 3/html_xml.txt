    Data formats such as JSON and XML are often used as the format for storing serialized data. 
    popular object-oriented programming languages provide either native support for serialization or 
    have libraries that add non-native capabilities for serialization to their feature 
    set. Java, .NET, C++, Node.js, Python, and Go, for example, all either have native serialization support or integrate with libraries for serialization.
